The methods working group of the German Association of Peace and Conflict Studies (AFK) held its 8th workshop on "Empirical Research on Peace and Conflict" on September 5th and 6th, 2023, at the University of the Bundeswehr University in Munich. The workshop was organized in cooperation with the Center for Crisis Early Warning (CCEW). The workshop focused on the application of various qualitative and quantitative methods in conflict research and explicitly encouraged early-career researchers to present their work. During the workshop, the 23 participants presented contributions on various aspects of peace and conflict research, such as gender-based violence, peace processes, post-conflict scenarios, and the use of unstructured data.

I'm a PhD student at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg.

My focus is on empirical conflict research. In particular, I am interested in the intersection between international, interstate, and intra-state dynamics for civil conflict. I take a special interest in quantitative methods, conflict prediction and how to apply natural language processing (NLP) approaches in political science.

I hold a M.Sc. in International Relations from the University of Essex, and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Innsbruck.

Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at the Center for Crisis Early Warning (CCEW), at the University of the Bundeswehr in Munich, investigating how to improve conflict prediction with text-as-data approaches (2021-2024) and providing scientific support for an IBM-led project developing a crisis early warning system for Germanyâ€™s Ministry of Defence (2021). Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant in an OeNB-funded project on sanctions dynamics at the University of Innsbruck (2019-2021). I also worked as a prevention of violent extremism (PVE) consultant at the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism in New York (2017-2019).

I'm a Research Associate at the Center for Crisis Early Warning (CCEW), at the University of the Bundeswehr in Munich.

My research focuses on intra-state conflict. In particular, I am interested in the intersection between international, interstate, and intra-state dynamics for civil conflict. I take a special interest in conflict prediction and how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to improve crisis early warning models.

I hold a M.Sc. in International Relations from the University of Essex, and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Innsbruck.

Previous to my work at the CCEW, I was working as a research associate at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich, providing scientific support for an IBM-led project developing a crisis early warning system for Germanyâ€™s Ministry of Defence. Before that, I worked as a research assistant in an OeNB-funded project on sanctions dynamics at the University of Innsbruck. I also worked as a prevention of violent extremism (PVE) consultant at the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism in New York.
